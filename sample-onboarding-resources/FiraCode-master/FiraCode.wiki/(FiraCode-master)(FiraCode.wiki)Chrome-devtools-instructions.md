## Installation steps

This process works by getting access to devtools stylesheets using custom themes; also works in Opera with the Download Chrome Extension installed

1. install the Fira Code font on your machine
1. follow steps to install a custom devtools theme, e.g. [zerodarkmatrix](https://github.com/mauricecruz/chrome-devtools-zerodarkmatrix-theme)
1. find the appropriate stylesheet `stable.css` or `canary.css` in your browser's `Extensions` directory on your file system
1. edit the section `CodeMirror-code` to include `font-family:"Fira Code"`

Voila
