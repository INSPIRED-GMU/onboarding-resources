# Guidelines

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of
your pull request being accepted:

* For a new feature or function, please **create an issue first** to discuss it
  with us before submitting a pull request.
* Keep your change as focused as possible.
  * If there are changes in multiple directories you would like to make
  that are not dependent upon each other, please submit them
  as separate pull requests.
* The pull request should have a useful title and description.
  * Explain the rationale for your change in the pull request using a [pull request template](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
