# Installing Semantic

### Note:  This page is still a work in progress

When setup is complete you'll find a set of folders:
```
|semantic
|--dist
|--src
|--tasks
```

`dist` is the output file for gulp build tasks. Don't make modifications to the files in `dist` your changes will be overwritten by the gulp build process.

`src` is where all the design source files are stored. {TODO explain definitions, site and themes}

`tasks` is where gulp tasks are defined and configured. If the installation was successful, you can safely ignore this folder too.


## Theming Guide

Semantic UI includes a default set of common web components including buttons, forms, sliders, tables, etc. Although you designer can certainly create new components from scratch, it's often faster and easier to modify one of the default components to look or behave as you would prefer.

Semantic UI components can be modified in several ways.
