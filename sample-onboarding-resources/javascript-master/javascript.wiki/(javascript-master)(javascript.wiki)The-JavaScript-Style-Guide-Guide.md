Everyone writes JavaScript a little differently. We finally decided it was time that we got together and agree on how we write JavaScript.

We describe it as a mostly reasonable approach to JavaScript.

We're releasing it under the MIT license, so please feel free to fork and use at your will. We don't expect everyone to agree with the way we do things, but we do hope this can help kick start your own style guide as a template or map of some sort.

Hope it helps!
