External Resources, Videos and Talks
===========================================

For written tutorials, see the [Tutorial section](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) of
the documentation.

New to Scientific Python?
==========================
For those that are still new to the scientific Python ecosystem, we highly
recommend the [Python Scientific Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/). This will help you find your footing a bit and will definitely improve your scikit-learn experience.  A basic
understanding of NumPy arrays is recommended to make the most of scikit-learn.

External Tutorials
===================

There are several online tutorials available which are geared toward
specific subject areas:

- [Machine Learning for NeuroImaging in Python](http://nilearn.github.io/)
- [Machine Learning for Astronomical Data Analysis](https://github.com/astroML/sklearn_tutorial)

And a list of more general tutorials:

- [A Bit of Data Science and Sklearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52zXNBaUKMM&list=PLgJhDSE2ZLxb33q-x5592LCiVRsHDxVf3), a 16 part tutorial that goes over the essential parts of sklearn used in data science.
