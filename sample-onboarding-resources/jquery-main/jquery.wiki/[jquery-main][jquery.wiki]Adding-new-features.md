The jQuery Core team receives many requests to add features to the library. Here are some of the criteria we use in our decisions on whether to add a feature:

* **Does it require access to jQuery internals?** If the feature needs information that only jQuery has, for example the list of events attached to an element, it is a candidate for feature addition.
* **Can jQuery itself benefit from the feature?** Features adding useful APIs that also improve the file size or performance inside jQuery itself are good candidates. 
* **Is the feature related to DOM operations?** jQuery's primary mission is to be a DOM library. Features beyond that are often better served by libraries such as [lodash](https://lodash.com/) for utilities or [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/) for SVG.
* **Is the need already served by a plugin?** If there is a jQuery plugin that already does the job well, there is little reason for us to add duplicate functionality inside the library. Simply use the plugin.
* **Does it change an existing API?** Adding new flags or signatures to existing APIs can break code that duck-punches the API. New arguments also complicate documentation and can create [confusing Boolean traps](https://ariya.io/2011/08/hall-of-api-shame-boolean-trap). 
* **Does it support best practice?** jQuery wants to make it easy to write good and fast code, so new features should follow that pattern. jQuery 1.9 actually [removed many features](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/) that lead to brittle or slow code.
