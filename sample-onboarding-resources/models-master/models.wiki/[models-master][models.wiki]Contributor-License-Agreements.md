Please fill out either the individual or
corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure
  you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
  then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it.
Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

**NOTE**: Only original source code from you and other people
that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository.

## Troubleshooting CLAs

### Using the wrong email address

> We found a Contributor License Agreement for you (the sender of this pull request), but were unable to find agreements for all the commit author(s) or Co-authors. If you authored these, maybe you used a different email address in the git commits than was used to sign the CLA (login here to double check)? If these were authored by someone else, then they will need to sign a CLA as well, and confirm that they're okay with these being contributed to Google.
In order to pass this check, please resolve this problem and then comment @googlebot I fixed it.. If the bot doesn't comment, it means it doesn't think anything has changed.

If **googlebot** adds the above comment to your pull request,
please **check your commit email address in the commit**.
It must be an email address associated with a CLA. 

Please check [this manual](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git)
if you need to change the email address you associate with your Git commits.
