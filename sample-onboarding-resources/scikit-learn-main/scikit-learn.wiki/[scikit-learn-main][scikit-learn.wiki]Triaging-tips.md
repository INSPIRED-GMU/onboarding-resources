_The goal of this wiki page is to clarify the meaning of the labels and milestones used to describe issues and pull requests in the scikit-learn project. This kind of information pertains to the wiki more than to the official documentation, as labels could and should evolve fast adapting to review practices and not the other way round.
Those pages are meant to be of some help in triaging with easy updatable contents._
