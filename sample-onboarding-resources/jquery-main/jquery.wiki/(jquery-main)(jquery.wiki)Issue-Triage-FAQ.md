### I want this feature!

jQuery is a mature library used by most web sites on the Internet. We're hesitant to add new features at this point, since most common needs are already satisfied by third-party plugins. See the [Adding New Features](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Adding-new-features) page.
